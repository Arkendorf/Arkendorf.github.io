			'<p>Flioneer is a pixel art roguelike where you adopt the mantle of a Flioneer, and pilot your aircraft across increasingly dangerous skies. As you continue your adventure, you\'ll unlock new weapons, fight bosses, and discover new lands.</p>
			<p>I created Flioneer from scratch as a class project, using Lua and the LÃ–VE game engine. Some features I\'m proud of include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Level difficulty system where enemies are dynamically spawned to maintain a certain difficulty threshold for each level.</li>
                <li>Several unique bossfights with custom enemies and dialogue.</li>
                <li>Randomized map system with custom points of interest to ensure every playthrough feels unique.</li>
                <li>Weapon customization, allowing players to slot different weapon types into their aircraft to add variety to their experience.</li>
                <li>In-game tutorial system that explains mechanics to the player as they appear, to gradually introduce the player to the game instead of explaining everything at once.</li>
                <li>Completely custom pixel art sprites created by hand.</li>
            </ul>',
