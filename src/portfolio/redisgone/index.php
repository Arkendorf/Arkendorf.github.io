			'<p>Red Is Gone is a narrative-based, mystery-solving game where you must discover clues to determine the whereabouts of Red, a missing child you\'ve been tasked to protect. Will you be able to find her in time, or will she fall prey to dangers that lurk in the woods?</p>
			<p>Red Is Gone started as a class project, then became a passion project. It was built using Lua and the LÃ–VE game engine, on top of a custom object-oriented framework I designed. Despite the fact that I\'ve created games before, this was my first real foray into creating a game primarily driven by its story, something that proved to be much more challenging than I anticipated. Despite this, I\'m very proud of the end result. Some of my favorite features of Red is Gone include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A detailed and engaging narrative presented through first-person dialogue, inspired by traditional Little Red Riding Hood tales.</li>
                <li>Storybook system where words can be dragged-and-dropped to fill out the story as the game progresses.</li>         
                <li>Hand-drawn pixel art graphics for clues and interfaces.</li>
                <li>Custom backgrounds created using generative AI, modified to fit the game\'s aesthetic.</li>
            </ul>',
